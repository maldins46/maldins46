## Hi there, I'm [@maldins46](https://www.riccardomaldini.it)!

My name is [Riccardo Maldini](https://www.riccardomaldini.it) and I am an MSc from the [University of Cesena](https://corsi.unibo.it/magistrale/IngegneriaScienzeInformatiche) and [University of Urbino](https://informatica.uniurb.it/triennale), in Italy. In my degree course, I've focused on data science, even if, as a tech enthusiast, everything concerting quality good code excites me üë®‚Äçüíª You can find more of my work on [my official website](https://www.riccardomaldini.it).

At the moment, I'm working as a Backend Engineer and Data Engineer at [MDOTM Ltd](https://www.mdotm.eu). As such, my daily-use technological stack includes Java, Spring Boot, Maven, MySQL, MongoDB and Python.

I am a tech enthusiast, particularly interested in the latest innovations concerning the Android Ecosystem. 
A personal hobby that I like to carry on in my free time is Mobile and Web Programming. As such, I've worked also with JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, Node, Kotlin for Android Studio, Flutter and AdobeXD for graphics and mocking.
